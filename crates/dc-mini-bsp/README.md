# DC Mini Board Support Package

The DC Mini Board Support Package (BSP) is a project that provides support for the dc mini embedded device. The BSP is built using the Rust programming language and leverages the Embassy-rs framework.

## Introduction

The DC Mini BSP enables developers to easily integrate the dc mini embedded device into their projects. It provides a set of software components, drivers, and APIs that abstract the low-level hardware details and facilitate the development of applications that interact with the dc mini device.

## Features

- **Hardware Abstraction**: The BSP abstracts the underlying hardware of the dc mini device, allowing developers to write code without worrying about the specific details of the device's internals.
- **Peripheral Drivers**: The BSP includes drivers for various peripherals of the dc mini device, such as GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, and more. These drivers provide a convenient interface for interacting with the device's peripherals.
- **Power Management**: The BSP provides power management features that allow developers to optimize power usage and control sleep modes of the dc mini device.
- **Embassy-rs Integration**: The BSP is built using the Embassy-rs framework, which provides a lightweight runtime for writing asynchronous, event-driven applications in Rust. Developers can leverage the features and benefits of Embassy-rs while working with the dc mini device.
- **Sample Code and Examples**: The BSP includes sample code and examples that demonstrate how to use the provided APIs and drivers. These resources serve as a starting point for developers and help them understand the capabilities of the dc mini device.

## Getting Started

To use the DC Mini BSP in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have Rust and Cargo installed on your development machine. You can install them from the official Rust website (https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the DC Mini BSP repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dc-mini/bsp.git
   ```
3. **Build and Install**: Navigate to the repository's directory and build the BSP using Cargo:
   ```
   cd bsp
   cargo build
   cargo install --path .
   ```
   This will build the BSP and install it as a package on your system.
4. **Integration**: In your own project, add the DC Mini BSP as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   dc_mini_bsp = "0.1.0"
   ```
5. **Import and Use**: Import the necessary components from the DC Mini BSP in your Rust code and start using them to interact with the dc mini device.

For detailed documentation and usage examples, please refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md) directory of the repository.
